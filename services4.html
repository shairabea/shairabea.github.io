			<p class='srvcText'>Binding</p>
			<p class="srvcTextSmall">Another important element of printing is ink. At Press Café we use only quality ink purchased from the machine brands we utilize. <br> 
				These are HP, Epson, Canon, and Kodak – all of which are highly reputable suppliers of colored and black & white ink all over the world. <br>
				We will guarantee that our ink does not run, smear, blotch. It also does not stick to other printed pages unlike the result in other digital printing presses.

			<p class="srvcTextSmall">Saddle stitch is another name for stapler binding. For documents that have less than 20 pages, saddle stitch is applicable. Any larger and the pages tend to curve and additional cutting services are needed to straighten out the pages.

			<p class="srvcTextSmall">Pages will be heated with plastic that will cause it to adhere to the a ready-made spine with cover. The sizes we have for the spine are from 10mm to 50mm. Documents with larger spines will need wire stitching or else the risk of breaking the heated plastic binding is greater.

			<p class="srvcText">Wire</p>
			<p class="srvcTextSmall">Your document will first be perforated with holes and we will thread, by machine, a wire binder. Wire binding is the most professional-looking, and also the most expensive. The sizes we have for the spine are from 5mm to 100mm. As the spine gets larger, the wires get thicker.
